Session 3: Android App Fundamentals &amp; User Interface Design 

UI for a Credit Card application that will help people with their credit
card debt.

Application based on linear layout in which Each and every row & column
hase equally spaced by weight property

Weight - It is an attribute which assigns an "importance" value to a view
in terms of how much space it should occupy on the screen .

For example, if there are three text fields and two of them declare a
weight of 1, while the other is given no weight, the third text field
without weight will not grow and will only occupy the area required by
its content. The other two will expand equally to fill the space
remaining after all three fields are measured. If the third field is
then given a weight of 2 (instead of 0), then it is now declared more
important than both the others, so it gets half the total remaining
space, while the first two share the rest equally.
